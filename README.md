# Pairs Game

An online pairs game in which the user has to find all matching cards in the fastest time and fewest moves.  

This project was developed to showcase my skillset and demonstrate my understanding of HTML5, CSS and Javascript.

For the design, I took inspiration from a classic and personal favourite game, Mario.

## User Journey

The user joruney consists of 3 main sections as listed in order below:

1. Users land on a welcome page with 'How to play' instructions and some input fields to toggle sound on/off and personalise by entering their name.
2. The following section launches the game. The user's progress will be tracked and displayed along the bottom of the screen. There is the option to pause or restart the game as well.
3. Once the user has found all pairs they will be served with a summary page detailing their stats. At this stage I've included options to either play again to beat their previous stats or restart entirely.

In addition to the above, I've included a header bar and footer with static links back to the homepage to restart the game or read instructions.
